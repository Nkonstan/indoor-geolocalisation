Neutral colors like white, cream, and light gray are popular, accented with splashes of color through artwork or textiles. Decor includes mirrors with gilded frames, chandeliers, and classic French ceramics or porcelain. French homes focus on sophistication and timeless appeal. Herringbone parquet flooring (point de Hongrie) is a classic feature in traditional apartments. Trumeau mirrors above fireplaces are characteristic of traditional French interiors.\n\n                3.
